# Remove-Duplicates-Efficiently
Remove duplicates in O(nlogn) in Python, full documentation and testing is included.

The function remove_duplicates(L) consumes a list L of natural numbers and uses a modification of the binary searching algorithm to replace all elements that appear more than once with -1. The code must run in O(nlogn) time.
